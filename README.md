# Cascade Tile Search  
This is a simple program to help you figure out exactly what tiles you have upon loading into a mission to help save time while rerolling. Simply launch run the script and the overlay will appear to the top right. When loading in to a mission, it will display the 3 main rooms in the map, along with how many exolizers will spawn in that room. Depending on the total amount of exolizers, the color of the HUD will change.  
10 or less Exolizers = Red  
11 Exolizers = Green  
12 Exolizers = Cyan  
13 Exolizers = Magenta
